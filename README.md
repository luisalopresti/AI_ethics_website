![alt text](https://github.com/luisalopresti/AI_ethics_website/blob/main/images/home.png?raw=true)
The content of this website has been elaborated in the context of a seminar concerning AI and human rights, held at the Department of Sociology and Social Research, at the University of Trento (2021).
This website does not aim to be exhaustive, rather to provide a non-technical overview on selected topics and hopefully generate some debate.

The creation of the website was not pursued during the said seminar, but rather it was a way to collect the resources (articles, videos, and podcasts) proposed during the meetings and the written productions.

The project include html, css, and php for comments submission.

Finally, the website is completely responsive and mobile friendly.
