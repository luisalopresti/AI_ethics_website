        <h1>Introduction to Artificial Intelligence</h1>
        <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is often described as a field that studies harwares 
        and softwares systems in order to build machines that mimic the human cognitive functions, <br> 
        and solve tasks normally associated with humans only, such as learning and problem solving. 
        In order to perform the tasks it is programmed to do, the machine is generally trained using 
        sophisticated machine learning algorithms, and its performances can even happen to be superior 
        to humans abilities. <br>
        But can AI really be considered "intelligence"? Does it really act like the human brain?</p>
        <br><br>
        <h1>What's Artificial Intelligence?</h1>
        <p>AI is not science fiction! Indeed, it is already quite present in our daily lives. <br> 
        Let's take a look at some of the main fields of applications and at its possible implications.</p>
        <div class='row'>
            <div class='column'>
                <h3>E-commerce & marketing</h3>
                <p>AI may help businesses to know their audience, and to develop business strategies and marketing analysis. </p>
                <br>

                <h3>Robotics & Domotics</h3>
                <p>Overcome disability issues and issues related to muscular strength.
                    Robots can also use AI technologies to detect objects and obstacles in their path and change direction. 
                    They can be a great help for transports of goods in health facilities, or for carring out repetitive tasks, such as cleaning,  
                    simplifying the house management.</p> 
            </div>
            <div class='column'>
                <h3>Health</h3>
                <p> AI may help and empower doctors and experts to make more precise and faster analysis and diagnosis. 
                    Thanks it its ability of detecting diseases and identifying cancer cells, or though monitoring health conditions.</p>

            <div class='column'>
                <h3>Mobility</h3>
                <p>AI can grant higher efficiency in the field of mobility, due to its characteristic fast decision-making process, and thanks to its great performances, it has the ability of reducing human errors.
                    </p>

            <div class='column'>
                <h3>Security</h3>
                <p>AI may be used for control and prevention of crimes, but several privacy and ethical issues arise in this context, and often people are concerned it may be used for malitious goals such as targeting and controlling people, expecially minorities, or avoiding political dissent.

                <p>AI has a great field of application in the games and free-time industry. Big Tech and social media companies are very interested in its application in this context in order to empoweer their platform by capturing the attention of the user and making them willing to spend more time in it.</p>
